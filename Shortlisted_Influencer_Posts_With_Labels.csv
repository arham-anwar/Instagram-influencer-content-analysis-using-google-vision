Right from the title the book has me it’s like a spider web that entangled me and every page unravels a layer that surprised me or rather I would say shocked me. Kudos to the author who so well has crafted a story with so many characters and each one of them with different layers and back stories. It’s a book that has every ingredient required for a perfect drama thriller. It has love, friendships, relationships, politics, greed, jealousy, adulatory, lust and more. It took me a couple of sitting to read the book as after few chapters I felt like analysing the characters and their stories as to their reasoning for their particular sin. It’s a story about umpteenth sins but all for one reason love. But the catch here is love for different emotions. Deep right!!! Hence I would says it’s a story with a lot of depth. To give you a little snippet it’s a story of three main characters Shaaman, Maya and Aahil. As maya arrives in Delhi to meet her husband Shaaman family and for a celebration, mysterious deaths start taking place in the house and what should have been a celebration turns catastrophic. There is a story between maya and aahil too which is sinful. Now you may wonder who is Aahil but if I tell you anything more it would be a spoiler. I would recommend you to read and unravel the mystery yourself. I also have to when I read the last book penned by the author I was amazed at the nail biting suspense thriller as I couldn’t till the end guess what was in store for me but here again she has amazed me and broken her own record with another suspense thriller. It’s a book I would recommend all mystery lovers who would like to have an amazing thrilling time.

The books is a sequel to a series but trust me it’s still a stand alone. It can be read independently and you will still not be clueless at any point. The title intrigued me from the first past itself and since I have read part one I was quite serious to know what’s in store in the second part. The Cursed Gem part 2 is when the lord of the past The Maharathi Ashwatthama reappears for the cursed gen and the wars between the kingdoms for two reasons to conquer and the old mystic weapon Divya Astra which is with Ujjayini Kingdom and also wanting to bring the fiend all to the glory of Ujjayni kingdom. All the characters and the plots are very well crafted. The story progresses flawlessly and smoothly inspite of so many characters. The writing and narration style of author makes the book very visualistic. The author through the stories and learning’s that he shares between the characters makes the narrative more engaging. Mythological fiction is a trend and there are numerous books out there but still this books is a fresher and ends with a cliffhanger leaving you for wanting more

The book is an autobiographical account of the author which just like the title suggest is a story of faith and miracles right from the day the author was to be born. I have known the author for a while and have read other books penned by him but was unaware of his journey (personal journey). Had a wide view of his professional journey and the to an extent about his spiritual journey but got a macro view how faith, prayers and miracles have guided him right from the start and how they have made him professionally and personally achieve much more. I won’t spoil the book by letting out the details but trust me this book will make you believe in faith and miracle. It will force you to see the daily life routine life beautifully and it will restore your faith in surrendering to the divine powers

To the one responsible for me being here on this planet. 

My mother,
Thank you for not allowing the messed up, rock-bottom, drugged-up version of me into your life. 

The moment you decided that you would no longer tolerate me near,  if I continued the path I was on, a defining moment in my life.

It isn't just limited to what we eat or what we do but also what we listen to. And nothing better than enjoying your fitness regime while listening to your favorite music. I recently discovered that feeling while trying Yamaha EP-E70A headphones. They take care of my listening health with listening care while I groove thru my workout session, also feature  noise-cancelling technology and ambient sound.
So, gear up with @yamahamusicindia and add that extra zing to your fitness regime.

Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between oral and general health. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a good oral hygiene in daily life. 

1️⃣ *Brush Twice Daily*: It is recommended to brush at least twice a day for two minutes each. Replace your brush every three to four months or even sooner. It is also advisable to use a soft-bristled brush.

2️⃣ *Rinse your mouth post meals*: Rinsing your mouth with plain water helps remove food residue from your tooth surfaces and any acids from your food or beverage that could soften your enamel.

3️⃣ *Visit your dentist regularly*: Schedule regular dental check-ups and clean-ups with your dentist. Doing so is the best way to ensure good oral health. 

This World Oral Health Day, @Sensodyne_In is sponsoring free dental consultations and if you haven’t already, visit www.sensodyne.in/dentist-checkup to book your appointment. 

Let’s pledge start adding these small steps to our routine, be more sensitive and take charge of our oral health!

It’s a book you would want to own it and keep it in the library. Every poem was profound. The thoughts in each one of them would stop me in tracks and would have me pondering over those words and lost in my thoughts. As the thoughts expressed by the author and the subject touched are so deep but are expressed splendidly through her poetry. I won’t write too much here since I think it’s best to just experience this book on its own but I would like to quote my favourite from her collection of poems 
  SHE 
She gives and does everything for everyone’s best 
Wishing for one day her soul and body could have a rest 
Where she be appreciated for things, she did not have any regret 
Words were never enough to praise her worth, cause she doesn’t fret. 

Start of time till now, she went through hardships in silence 
She shouldered and burdened your problems and talks but no one there to listen to her laments, 
Her bones were crushed and her heart was damaged 
But she’s a Shero, curtailed behind nameless heroes, she never backed. 

She faced things head - on, was afraid but brave 
And was stamped in each step, she didn’t cave,
Her name is not her identity, nothing is her property, they haze
They blame her for the happenings, as she struggles to cross life’s maze. 

Remember that she is the creator of all things,
Without her there cease to exist these human beings,
 She deserves the world to be treated like the queen she is even without her crown.
This world won’t be ready to face her anger and no one can drag her down. 

It’s a beautiful book of poetry, which can be enjoyed by beginner readers too as it’s in simple words and harmonious rhymes which makes its a quick and interesting read.

Mythological genre is one of my favourites and so is this book. Mahagatha - 100 tales from the puranas. I was smitten write from the time I laid my eyes on the cover. The best part of the tales if that it’s in a chronological order and you cannot start randomly from any chapter. I had set a ritual of either reading a couple of tales in the morning or at night before going to bed. The stories are complimented with a few illustrations throughout the book which I am going to colour soon and still be connected to the book. The author has narrated the Mahagatha in such a simple and entertaining way that you get glued and can visualise the entire yugas. With his words he transports you to the 250 CE to 1500 CE. #i highly recommend this one if you want to enlighten yourselves with Hindu mythology in an entertaining way.

I get asked this question the most when I’m on trips without Dua but would it be the same if I was a man? 
I am first and foremost a mother to Dua, but I wonder, how would Dua feel if I sidelined my passions because of this very gendered expectation we only place on women?

The reality is, it’s so difficult being away from my daughter and she’s never not on my mind. Feeling this deep emotion, however, doesn’t take away from the fact that I am also a very ambitious and hardworking woman who loves building my own legacy that Dua can one day be proud of. 

We can experience both emotions without disregarding the other and we can cherish our roles as mothers and still pursue other passions. But ultimately this is a choice, and it is mine to make. 

I respect mothers that make the choices that most resonate with their values, and this does not have to be the same choice as mine. 
My wish is that we all respect mothers and the choices we make without jumping to label anyone as a “bad mother” when we never know the full story. 

I know Dua is having so much fun with her Dad, and this time they have together is also valuable for both of them. I can’t wait to see them both very soon! ❤️

 A piece of contemporary design created from the awareness of a modern attitude and of the intentional revival of a historical object from the archive: Gucci Attache is a bag that reinterprets tradition and the system of House codes while transporting a silhouette, which draws from an intuition and an attitude of the 1970s, into the present through a narrative and gesturality outside the confines of gender, feminine or masculine.

It’s a story of Shreya and Rishabh and their budding romance since school days. The romance in this book felt like an Insta love and went to quick for me. The narration of the author gave me a feeling as if the protagonist Shreya was sharing her tale with me over a cup of coffee which makes the read quick and pacy. I enjoyed the read and what I liked about the book is that though it’s a piece of fiction a lot of parts and emotions felt relatable. It’s a heart warming story and a tear jerker book.

The fashion cycle is constant but there are still moments that ground us in artistry and tradition. The Gucci Jackie 1961 bag is one such moment.
 
A key design of The House for decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the #GucciJackie1961, beholds the Jackie story, but with a new perspective. An emblematic bag known for its half-moon shape, pared-down silhouette, and sleek piston hardware now carries itself with a non-binary attitude, transcending social constructs and time itself.

The Jackie 1961 boldly takes on any outfit, perfect for any occasion with its timeless elegance. To me, the Gucci Jackie 1961 bag represents an identity that is always growing but nevertheless stays connected to the core of its beauty.

Especially in my marriage.

If I didn’t have persistence I wouldn’t be married to the woman of my dreams.

I’ve said it many times before, and so has she- she didn’t want anything to do with me when she first met me. She hated me.

Fast forward almost 2 decades and 2 kids later... we’re still standing strong.

Before I ever met Elena, I knew the type of wife I wanted but more importantly, I knew how committed I wanted to be to her. When I commit, I go all in. She was no exception. If anything, she was the rule.

I look back at the day when we got married, July 4, 2004, and I’m beyond grateful.

The reason for the legacy I’ll leave behind starts with my wife.

In life, you need a partner that will not only push you past your limits but will tell you the truth, no matter how harsh. You need a partner who aligns with your purpose and works at it with you every single day. We’re not perfect, but we know exactly what’s needed to make a marriage successful.

To celebrate our upcoming anniversary, we’re doing a Couples Retreat where you can join us with your partner and other 10X couples on April 15-16 in Los Cabos, Mexico.

I am a big sucker for romantic books. A types of ram tic genres are my favourites and vineyards of love right from the title had my heart. To begin with I adored the colourful tree too on the cover. It’s a quick read and something which is very relatable in today’s day and hour. The story is of two people obviously Avisha and Gautam it’s their love story in today’s world with the number of breakups and fear of commitments, reluctance of falling in love or giving love a second chance. All these emotions are a part of their journey and it’s their tale of connection with their baggages. The book starts from falling in love at first sight and the tale continues along with the journey. It’s a quick read and I would recommend for all mushy lovers there who love to read that are simple and sweet 💕

Let’s start cover to cover. Right from the the cover I knew it’s going to be a fun read and the book kept up to my expectations. This is one of those books that makes you smile and laugh along your busy schedule. The book is narrated in a chatty and a sectoral style which makes the read interesting and you sublimely are an integral part of the story. As the title suggest the book is about Shakuntala Bassi the bride to be and her father Ramswarup Bassi. Well Shakuntala has rejected thousand of boys but now she is rejected by Jacky Zinta by her dream man for a bizarre reason and we all know how difficult it is to take rejection. So anyways this father- daughter due team up to make Jacky agree to marriage. Also I guess all father and daughters will relate to it either the situations or the bond that Shakuntala and Ramswarup share. The question that lies here and the stories begins will they succeed? It’s a book I would recommend to read as it’s fast paced and entertaining. I throughly enjoyed it.

Her journey as a beauty entrepreneur in Europe began unexpectedly, but through her strong vision and diligence, she succeeded in creating her name in the world. Starting with the world's first Ayurvedic brand, she fused traditional Indian concepts like Ayurvedic therapy with popular Western practices such as yoga and skin care products, bringing a unique blend of Indian aesthetics to the Western market. With her innovative approach, she quickly gained recognition and secured angel funding, establishing herself as a leading Indian entrepreneur in Europe. Just like TECNO Phantom X2 Pro, which has been crafted with advanced technology, mind-blowing design, and latest innovation that gives Beyond The Extraordinary experience.

Right from the very beginning from the title itself the book had me. What an intriguing title it’s a short novella with small chapters which makes it a day or two to read. It was my first book of the year and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this piece of fiction penned by Jayanthi as the narration style is fresh and I also like the style of storytelling specially the format. There are many other quotes and sub plots that I loved in the story  that I am itching to tell you all but I shouldn’t land up giving you all spoilers. I rather have you’ll discover it but never the less let me tell you a little about the story Susan is a kid from Goa and she has found a pen pal from Singapore Suiyi who is of the same age and they share their emotion through their letters. ( It took me back in time when I had a pen pal from Nagpur and I enjoying writing my heart out to her) back to the story they both have turbulent personal lives and though both are in different places and have different journeys in life they are still very connected. The author through her story and characters portage strong human behaviours, emotions; she has laid out beautiful different complexities and challenges that each one of us face within our circle with our closed ones or with the ones in our surroundings.
I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoy fiction and emotions that feel inspired from real life events and are looking for a quick thrill read to start their reading challenge.

I love reading love stories as they all are unique in their own way. It’s my favourite genre and the cover just like it’s title promises unique love story. The story is of Raj, Deepak, and  Kashish but not the usual triangle. The book has some fresh air and as you read and the story keeps unfolding it will amaze you. It’s a story not only about life but also about Afterlife. I liked the narration style of the author ( here would like to bring a little thing to your notice that avid readers don’t go on the language just read and flow with the story and the characters. Dwell deep into that) for the beginners it’s apt will make you fall in love with reading too as it’s a short book with a powerful story which you can read at one go or in a couple of sittings. I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional grip that the author has on you with his story and I PROMISE you will too

each of whom are pioneers in their field because of their passion and dedication not only towards their profession but towards creating and establishing a healthier world.

@sonushivdasani is the founder and designer of @discoversoneva and the person behind the outstanding Soneva Soul which was a creation of his personal experience with fighting and overcoming cancer and then integrating all the treatments and so much more into it. 

Our Talkers Table (to be revealed soon, stay tuned) is all of us sharing our zeal and experience of our respective fields and bonding over our common purpose of improving health for each and everyone around us. 

@parineetasethi the power house of @globalspa_mag not only organized this incredible Talkers Table but also managed to get the amazing @rohanshrestha to shoot a cover with us.

Me No Pause Me play by Manoj Kumar Sharma 

I highly recommend this book to all. It’s a book that I would ask All you to read from Men to Women. It’s a game changer for the society if all us resonate with it which I am sure you will. You know it’s a book which highlights a very strong message which actually we all take very lightly in our lives. If you see the Title without without space you will realise what the story is all about ME NO PAUSE —— Menopause. Yes it’s about it that all we women go through but along with us even our families are a part Because the change is not just in the hormones there is a change physically as well as emotionally. It’s a short book with deep message for everyone out there. It’s like perfect to the T as it explains the entire journey of a women in all spheres of her life. He has touched all the challenges she faces from biological to emotional. The author has put across with utmost simplicity. Also the characters are just three and each of them are so extremely well crafted that you feel you know each of them. Also the way the story culminates and it ends keeps you in positive spirits. It’s a soulful read

I have read books penned by the author in the past and I must say he is one of my few favourite authors when it comes to reading this genre. He can hook you right from the very first page of his book. It’s happened with me in the past and it’s the same feeling right now while I was reading “The Highway Murders”. The book is based on a true story of a psycho killer named M Jaishankar. The story is breathtaking and can be read in a sitting or two but I took my time as the details are gory and I needed my break time from part or part. The author as usual has very very well researched the topic and written the story in a way that it catches your eye and mind from the cover right UPTO the end. It’s a fascinating true story which I would recommend all to read who like this genre it’s got the facts but it still doesn’t sound academic. It’s gruesome but very intriguing. So happy thrill reading this weekend

The title and the cover lured me@into reading the love story and I have to say that the author has very brilliantly touched a very important topic and narrated it in a light manner. It highlights the subject of Consent. A topic which is very realistic and important part of every relationship well to give you a little snippet it’s a story of Anuj and Ruchi and what transpires later when Anuj kisses her without her consent. What fate has in store what transpires later when Ruchi disapproves and also decides to discontinue their relations and expresses her desire never to see him again. Arya Khanna, RU his aunt enters as a fairy god mother for Anuj and helps him Coe with it but she also helps him understand relationships as well as to mend things with Ruchi because he truly loves her and keeps pursuing her. It may seem like a simple love story but you in for a surprise that you never expected. The language and narrative style of the author makes the book fast paced and can be read by all I would strongly recommend this book to young adults and also to readers who love this genre 

Happy Reading :)

Do you believe in ghosts? Do you think some places are haunted ? Do you believe in super natural powers? 

The reading world is clearly clear about this book and the extent to which this novel will scare you Co relates directly to whether you believe in these events. However writer convinces you into this world with his simple narration style. The chapters are short and the twist and turns are in abundance. It’s a story of five friends Maya, Ravi, Riya, Shreya and Mayank who met for a reunion after ten long years. It a story of how their joyous moment turned out to be the worst nightmare. I can’t disclose more as I might land up giving spoilers so rather you’ll buy your spoiled and spook yourselves as once you begin to read the author traps you in his dark plot. I rate it high as a horror book it’s done it’s job amazingly well.

I’m not much of a department store kind of shopper , always preferring the charming stand alone stores, off the beaten path. 
But Printemps has a certain je ne sais quoi which you need to see to believe. Aside from the stunning interiors and beautiful curation , they have an entire floor dedicated to vintage finds including hard to get Hermes bags and fine jewellery. They also have a space dedicated to last seasons hot pieces sold at reduced prices. If that’s not enough to sway you , they have a great personal shopper service and if you can’t make it to the store , they have an entire set up to help make your online shopping experience personalised and seem less. 
Wow, I just realised I literally went on a rant but I truly was very impressed.

Right from the title it has my heart and mind I was curious to solve the riddle and there was no stopping as I perused the book it was a complete page turner thriller. It was fun and fast paced. It’s a thriller but quite different from the ones that I have read lately. The story and the characters are very well crafted by the author it’s so descriptive that the visuals automatically play in your mind. 
To give you a little clue before you get on to solve the riddle yourself. The story is of Siddh an interior designer, an introvert personality and has an obsession with blue butterflies. One day he find a mysterious box and that contains a butterfly and a diary and does begins his quest to find the answers of what when where and how did this box reached the doorstep and so does ours. I would love to say a lot more in my excitement but I rather have you ll read it for yourself and enjoy the thrill.

BUT, I did not do it by myself, it was a collective energy shared within a small group of individuals guided and led by the one and only Anne Hockett.
My journey, my experience throughout the days were amazing! as it helped me not only feel light and cleanse my GUT but find grounding within even though I was still working and training clients!!!

It’s a very exciting read as it’s a historical fiction with a lot of mythological references which were exciting factor me as I love both the genres and it’s rare that they are clubbed together. It’s a book which completely absorbs you into its pages. The story is fascinating and authors narration style, character crafting and minute detailing makes you engrossed in the read. It’s a book that needs your 100 percent attention as there are lots of tales woven together along with the main tale of Bappa Raval’s ascent to the throne. Special claps for the author for his research as the book contains a lot of historical information which will excite the history enthusiast. The narrative style of the author takes you in the past of these historical figures, his descriptive style makes you feel you are in that era. The entire scene comes to life. The cliffhanger that the author leaves you at makes you want to read the other parts soon. I am impatiently waiting for the sequels to follow. I recommend this book as it’s entertaining and enlightening as it’s based on historical heroes who have been forgotten or we aren’t aware of them besides that has a lot of spiritual layering to it

I suggest you do so it will help you being disciplined, won’t let you go into a reading slump and it’s fun too to set a target and achieve it. Last year I I read 114 (one hundred and fourteen) books time to set a new target and challenge in 2023. Let’s see what this year holds. I use Goodreads to set my reading challenge 📚

Just wanted to come out here and thank you all for the amount of love you showered upon her. She saw it, she read it, she devoured it. YOUR COMMENTS MADE HER SMILE. You all were her absolute favorite and she would always ask me ‘Taari badi friends kem che’… 

The timing was uncanny. It was almost like she waited just to see her great grandson and hold him. She waited to see that I was doing okay in my new role as a mother. And then she left us in the most serene & peaceful way and there is no other way I could imagine for someone as spiritual & positive as her.

In my heart forever…. 💕
