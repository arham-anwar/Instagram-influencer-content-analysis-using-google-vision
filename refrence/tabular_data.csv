They are so easy to grab and go and integrate into my wellness routine. I love them whole as a healthy snack, in my salads, as part of my mains to boost the nutritional value, and in my desserts. Eating just a handful of California walnuts, which are packed with 2.5g plant-based omega-3 ALA, 4g protein, and 2g fiber, keeps me fueled and focused throughout the day.  

California walnuts are a smart choice. The ideal climate, fertile soils, and the farmers dedication to providing high quality make them one of the best options available in the market. They combine nutrition, versatility, high quality, exceptional flavour and so much more. That’s why I say #ThinkWalnutsThinkCalifornia

California walnuts are available at all grocery stores and e-commerce sites. Make sure to look for the California Walnuts logo mark, “California” or “Californian” on the package or produce of the USA to ensure that you are buying genuine, high-quality California walnuts.

Right from the title the book has me it’s like a spider web that entangled me and every page unravels a layer that surprised me or rather I would say shocked me. Kudos to the author who so well has crafted a story with so many characters and each one of them with different layers and back stories. It’s a book that has every ingredient required for a perfect drama thriller. It has love, friendships, relationships, politics, greed, jealousy, adulatory, lust and more. It took me a couple of sitting to read the book as after few chapters I felt like analysing the characters and their stories as to their reasoning for their particular sin. It’s a story about umpteenth sins but all for one reason love. But the catch here is love for different emotions. Deep right!!! Hence I would says it’s a story with a lot of depth. To give you a little snippet it’s a story of three main characters Shaaman, Maya and Aahil. As maya arrives in Delhi to meet her husband Shaaman family and for a celebration, mysterious deaths start taking place in the house and what should have been a celebration turns catastrophic. There is a story between maya and aahil too which is sinful. Now you may wonder who is Aahil but if I tell you anything more it would be a spoiler. I would recommend you to read and unravel the mystery yourself. I also have to when I read the last book penned by the author I was amazed at the nail biting suspense thriller as I couldn’t till the end guess what was in store for me but here again she has amazed me and broken her own record with another suspense thriller. It’s a book I would recommend all mystery lovers who would like to have an amazing thrilling time.

Consider that the Mirai is a California-only model and suddenly that ‘Limited’ badge on the trunk means more than just the $66,000+ price tag.

Filling it up is like filling it up with gas, except you have to do it at hydrogen stations which are few and far between (once you’ve waited behind the other Mirai owners, see photo). It then operates like an EV. In essence, this feels like a fat 4,300 lb electric Camry except it powers the rear wheels and rides softer. Make no mistake, It’s an incredibly pleasant companion.

The 300 lb ft of torque is immediate and smooth, although the 182 hp means that past the initial push it chills out HARD, achieving a 9+ second 0-60. It wins traffic lights, not quarter miles. I’ve included a video.

The cabin, despite the vehicle’s length (same as a BMW 5 Series) is surprisingly modest in size. The trunk isn’t huge either. But like the Crown we just tested, it feels lexus-lite, although a smidge last gen. Plush seats, nice materials. And a JBL sound system that ACTUALLY has some bass. The new Prius, the Corollas and the Crown would like to share some of that please.

It was $108 to fill up at the station from almost empty. That’s supposed to give me 400 miles of range but for some reason it was showing 285. Yeah not cheap, BUT IT CLEANS THE AIR AS IT DRIVES. And it also pisses out the bottom when you click the H2O button. So that’s fun.

In theory, this is better than EV or ICE. It drives like an EV, which is superior in every way for a daily driver and yet you can fill it up in just a few minutes. That's the best of both worlds, no?

I googled why it isn’t more popular and got this: “The vast majority of car companies have turned away from hydrogen because of the high density of energy consumed in its production, as well as poor funding and backing from governments.”

That and I’m sure all the would-be owners don’t want to pay 70 Gs just to deal with Hindenburg jokes all day.

The Mirai is an expensive way to drive guilt-free, but if you can make it work, more power to you. (And more power to the Mirai please).

I’d never heard that before. I was insulted, but he was right (and hilarious). It’s hard to admit this on such a public forum but…I do oftentimes skip leg day. And guess what, so does the 2023 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. Change the badge though, and this thing is a Lexus. Sort of. 

I say it skips leg day because it produces 243hp from a 2.5L 4-cyl hybrid and takes almost 9 seconds to hit 60mph. The CVT also groans monotonously until the end of time while you do it. And somehow I STILL like this car. Bizarre.

And that’s not even the end of my complaints. The heated seats max out at 30-minute-old-cadaver levels of warm and the head-up display compass was stuck on North no matter which direction I faced. And yet STILL, I’m a fan of this car. Why?

Price. Optioned to the max for 59K CAD/49K USD, you get a comfortable, 35mpg, awd, three-row, nicely riding, well insulated Toyota that drives perfectly fine and has all the tech you could ever need, at the touch of actual buttons. The JBL sound system is good, the rear camera and 360 tech blows Honda out of the water and did I mention the seats are lovely? The ventilated part works very well, as does the heated steering wheel.

And the cabin, how is this not a Lexus? From soft touch materials to varnished woods, this thing feels like a classy product. First impressions in the driveway, I couldn’t understand why it only costs what it does.

Only once I started using the throttle did I notice the cost savings. Goes slow, sounds awful and CVTs can go die now please. Spoiler: I now have an RX500h in the driveway that truly demonstrates what a 4 cylinder hybrid, when paired with a six speed transmission, can be like.

But if you can get over that, I think the Highlander is as good as it looks (okay yes a Kia Telluride looks cooler) and no doubt there are those that would champion the cheaper non-hybrid trims, but my neighbour’s shiny new Highlander Hybrid has already been stolen off his driveway and shipped overseas (Sorry about that, Ian) so I’d say it's certainly desirable enough.

Words on the RX500h coming soon.

The books is a sequel to a series but trust me it’s still a stand alone. It can be read independently and you will still not be clueless at any point. The title intrigued me from the first past itself and since I have read part one I was quite serious to know what’s in store in the second part. The Cursed Gem part 2 is when the lord of the past The Maharathi Ashwatthama reappears for the cursed gen and the wars between the kingdoms for two reasons to conquer and the old mystic weapon Divya Astra which is with Ujjayini Kingdom and also wanting to bring the fiend all to the glory of Ujjayni kingdom. All the characters and the plots are very well crafted. The story progresses flawlessly and smoothly inspite of so many characters. The writing and narration style of author makes the book very visualistic. The author through the stories and learning’s that he shares between the characters makes the narrative more engaging. Mythological fiction is a trend and there are numerous books out there but still this books is a fresher and ends with a cliffhanger leaving you for wanting more

Meaning 'pure cotton' this is a slow brand with thoughtful pieces that i always find myself lusting after, season after season. Like this 'a-dress-cannot-get-easier-yet-goddess-like' dress that's shibori dyed in 100% cotton mulmul. Tie -up at one shoulder, no need for a bra or keeping that core tight all day and two deep pockets ;)
There's really nothing more you can ask for.
Paired with some vintage and some random silver nick nacks I've accrued over the years and white sneakers so that i can comfortably walk all day at art fair ❤️
This is a dress i know I'll wear all my life (like all my other kharakapas pieces I've had from over the years).

You gotta wake up early and stay up late. You gotta hustle harder and smarter than everyone else. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it!

Now, some of y'all might be thinking, ""ET, I'm only 70% there. That's not enough to make it happen."" But let me tell you, that 70% is all you need to get started. That 70% is the foundation for the other 30% to build on. And trust me, when you keep putting in that effort, that 30% will come. It's just a matter of time.

But here's the thing, fam. If you're one of those people who only puts in 10% or 20%, you'll never see your dreams come true. You'll always be stuck wondering what could have been. But not you! You're the one who's gonna put in that 70%. You're the one who's gonna chase those dreams until you catch them!

The beauty of this book, however, is the transformation it can have daily in course-correcting as the Narrator's voice tells me unhelpful stories.

The book is an autobiographical account of the author which just like the title suggest is a story of faith and miracles right from the day the author was to be born. I have known the author for a while and have read other books penned by him but was unaware of his journey (personal journey). Had a wide view of his professional journey and the to an extent about his spiritual journey but got a macro view how faith, prayers and miracles have guided him right from the start and how they have made him professionally and personally achieve much more. I won’t spoil the book by letting out the details but trust me this book will make you believe in faith and miracle. It will force you to see the daily life routine life beautifully and it will restore your faith in surrendering to the divine powers

Practically speaking, most of us spend more waking time at the office than anywhere else. That means if we expect to use the Gratitude Advantage to our benefit, work is actually the best place to do it. ⁠

And as a leader, it’s important to remember that people will only go so far in the performance of a duty. They will underperform when they feel underappreciated.⁠

If you want people’s very best, you have to have their hearts. You can’t demand this or even buy it with a paycheck. Gratitude is the most effective currency for keeping people engaged and performing at their best. That’s true for you and the people you lead.⁠

Our relationship was a mere blip on the radar, lasting just three months. Thankfully, I had enough know-how in coaching and self-awareness to cut my losses and start healing.

But the poor guy who followed in my footsteps? Let's just say, his experience was a world of hurt. He was left with a hefty bill and a court case to deal with.

The whole ordeal was so traumatic that he actually tracked me down for advice.

Sadly, I've heard countless stories from both men and women in recent years, describing the pain and suffering they endure at the hands of narcissistic partners.

They know they need to leave, but feel powerless and unsure of where to turn.

So I have decided to share my 6 steps that I have supported many of my coaching clients in the past with so they can build their power and confidence back up to move on from this toxic relationship that is draining them.

Again, I don’t think we should label every relationship partner ‘narcissistic’ that doesn’t work out well.

Most are other wound and trauma based patterns that play out in co-dependent relationships.

Sometimes though there are real cases of narcissistic abuse and so if you feel that you are experiencing this and want to leave then you may want to consider some of these steps.

Please share this with anyone you feel is experiencing this and needs to know ways to move forward.

Praying this helps you 🙏🏼❤️

It’s time to break free from the cycle of abuse and reclaim your power.

Leaving a narcissist is necessary for your mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and the ability to create healthy relationships based on trust and respect.

You deserve better, take the first step towards freedom today.

Loved the food, loved the cute interiors that make me feel as if I'm lunching in my own kitchen and puts me more at ease while eating (not that I need to feel more at ease while eating iykwim)

~ Burrata salad
~ Minestrone soup (not pictured but YUM)
~ The salmon large plate (SO good)
~ Mushroom gnocchi

Research has shown that there is a strong correlation between oral and general health. Therefore, it is imperative to maintain a good oral hygiene in daily life. 

1️⃣ *Brush Twice Daily*: It is recommended to brush at least twice a day for two minutes each. Replace your brush every three to four months or even sooner. It is also advisable to use a soft-bristled brush.

2️⃣ *Rinse your mouth post meals*: Rinsing your mouth with plain water helps remove food residue from your tooth surfaces and any acids from your food or beverage that could soften your enamel.

3️⃣ *Visit your dentist regularly*: Schedule regular dental check-ups and clean-ups with your dentist. Doing so is the best way to ensure good oral health. 

This World Oral Health Day, @Sensodyne_In is sponsoring free dental consultations and if you haven’t already, visit www.sensodyne.in/dentist-checkup to book your appointment. 

Let’s pledge start adding these small steps to our routine, be more sensitive and take charge of our oral health!

Thank You so much Mr & Mrs Ghosh the President and Vice President of the school for inviting me as the Chief Guest to inaugurate the event. It was truly an enthralling experience visiting various stalls put up by the students promoting their business ideas. I truly appreciate the vision of the school, through which they are empowering students to tap into their untapped potential, and are giving them opportunities to step into the world of entrepreneurship. To be an entrepreneur one needs to have at-least 10 possible moves for their business and ideas for execution, calculative mind, consistency and more over courage. And watching these kids carrying these core values with utmost confidence, truly inspired me and I was in an aww. Right from 5 to 18 years of age, so many young minds sharing their vision was indeed a treat to watch. Well success is not an event, it’s a process. My best wishes to these students as they embark on the journey of becoming successful entrepreneurs in near future.

It’s a book you would want to own it and keep it in the library. Every poem was profound. The thoughts in each one of them would stop me in tracks and would have me pondering over those words and lost in my thoughts. As the thoughts expressed by the author and the subject touched are so deep but are expressed splendidly through her poetry. I won’t write too much here since I think it’s best to just experience this book on its own but I would like to quote my favourite from her collection of poems 
  SHE 
She gives and does everything for everyone’s best 
Wishing for one day her soul and body could have a rest 
Where she be appreciated for things, she did not have any regret 
Words were never enough to praise her worth, cause she doesn’t fret. 

Start of time till now, she went through hardships in silence 
She shouldered and burdened your problems and talks but no one there to listen to her laments, 
Her bones were crushed and her heart was damaged 
But she’s a Shero, curtailed behind nameless heroes, she never backed. 

She faced things head - on, was afraid but brave 
And was stamped in each step, she didn’t cave,
Her name is not her identity, nothing is her property, they haze
They blame her for the happenings, as she struggles to cross life’s maze. 

Remember that she is the creator of all things,
Without her there cease to exist these human beings,
 She deserves the world to be treated like the queen she is even without her crown.
This world won’t be ready to face her anger and no one can drag her down. 

It’s a beautiful book of poetry, which can be enjoyed by beginner readers too as it’s in simple words and harmonious rhymes which makes its a quick and interesting read.

Mythological genre is one of my favourites and so is this book. Mahagatha - 100 tales from the puranas. I was smitten write from the time I laid my eyes on the cover. The best part of the tales if that it’s in a chronological order and you cannot start randomly from any chapter. I had set a ritual of either reading a couple of tales in the morning or at night before going to bed. The stories are complimented with a few illustrations throughout the book which I am going to colour soon and still be connected to the book. The author has narrated the Mahagatha in such a simple and entertaining way that you get glued and can visualise the entire yugas. With his words he transports you to the 250 CE to 1500 CE. #i highly recommend this one if you want to enlighten yourselves with Hindu mythology in an entertaining way.

The eleventh episode of my first scripted podcast is now live! The above is a snippet.

The “Legend of COCKPUNCH” podcast debuted at #1 in “Fiction” on Apple Podcasts and landed in the Top 100 for all podcasts on Apple Podcasts.

Everything can be found at cockpunch.com/podcast, or you can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Search “cockpunch” and you’ll find it.

If you like fantasy or world-building, this will be my attempt to blend Tolkien with Alice in Wonderland. That’s the aspirational goal, at least. So, if you’d like a short break each week from doomscrolling, I invite you to join me on a strange adventure full of secrets, magic, and a tournament of champions…

No famous people. No writers. No speakers. No CEOs. No sales leaders. No event planners. No HR people. No book agents. No videographers. No distributors. No one in the public eye. 

SO WHAT?

You have to architect your future. You build from nothing. You lay the bricks and you build a temple with your own thoughts and habits and choices day after day. You build the future you desire not wish what you had. 

Doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s just required. 

Keep at it my friend. Keep adding value to others. Keeep serving. Keep believing and improving day by day. Keep treating others with kindness and respect. You’ll be surprised one day where it takes you. 

Your coach,
Brendon.

Something that has helped me the most during my pregnancy has been yoga, I have spoken openly multiple times about how my pregnancy hasn’t been the easiest and most fun compared to some lucky mamas. But there’s also a flip side to it all, While there are days(everyday) where I feel sooo sick, there are also days where my body makes me feel so strong, empowered, excited for what is to come. Gosh I have my baby growing in me(still can’t believeeeee it ) I feel it now everyday. 
Our bodies are amazing! 
There are good days, there are bad days and then the realllyy bad days 🤦🏻‍♀️ and I feel that Yoga has really helped me get my energy back to get through it all, making me feel a little like myself again. Funnily me being the restless person I am I always kept thinking that yoga is not for me. And now here I am waiting for my Monday/wed/Fridays waiting to get to class. I’m ready to 🕺🏻 after 😂
My teacher Piyush makes me start and end my end my class holding my stomach and thanking my body for always supporting me. Which is a great reminder to have that gratitude and love for your body for what it’s doing for you. 

To growing stronger everyday ♥️ and the biggest thank you to @anshukayoga

But what if I told you that our minds are actually more like a garden, with the power to cultivate and prune new neural pathways through a concept known as neuroplasticity?

We have the ability to rewire our brains and break free from the limitations of our past experiences and thought patterns.

No matter our age or circumstances, we can shift our mindset and design the life we truly deserve.

And if you're passionate about helping others do the same, then I have an incredible opportunity for you.

I'm currently certifying coaches to become full-time Influential Coaches, armed with the tools, frameworks, and exercises to guide people towards real, tangible results.

Not only that, but I'll also teach you how to build a thriving online coaching business and attract clients.

So if you're ready to make a difference in people's lives and turn your passion for transformation into a successful career, simply DM me the word 'COACH' now and let's get started on this journey together!

⁠
Consider this: have you ever studied for an exam while feeling tired, stressed, or distracted?⁠
⁠
If so, you may have noticed that it was harder to remember the material when it came time for the test.⁠
⁠
That's because a negative or distracted state can hinder your brain's ability to encode information, making it harder to recall later.⁠
⁠
On the other hand, a positive, focused, and relaxed state can boost your brain's receptiveness to new information and increase the likelihood of retaining it.⁠
⁠
It's crucial to remember that your state is just as important as the information itself when it comes to learning. 🧠⁠
⁠
That's why taking care of yourself and creating a limitless learning environment is vital for boosting retention and recall to new heights.⁠
⁠
So, let's optimize your state and unlock your limitless potential! ⚡️⁠

⁠
👉Enthusiasm - When we’re full of enthusiasm, it’s infectious and sets the tone and pace for the company.⁠
👉Effort - Great leaders lead by example and expect the same from their team that they expect of themselves.⁠
👉Endurance - There will always be ups and downs. Your ability to stay positive and keep pushing forward despite obstacles is crucial.⁠
⁠
 But there’s a cost to this level of energy that can have unwanted consequences.⁠
⁠
We work with business owners, just like you, in dozens of industries that come to us on the bitter edge of burnout. You may be ready to walk away and do something else or you may be holding work and your home life together—even if just barely.⁠
⁠
If you’d like to explore how you can create work-life balance in your company, you’re invited to a free Business Growth Coaching Call.⁠
⁠
This coaching session is 45 minutes of clarity and wisdom for your business. Whether you work with us more closely or not, the goal of this session is to help you understand the biggest sticking points keeping you from the life and business that you want and to come up with some concrete steps to help you move past them.⁠

I get asked this question the most when I’m on trips without Dua but would it be the same if I was a man? 
I am first and foremost a mother to Dua, but I wonder, how would Dua feel if I sidelined my passions because of this very gendered expectation we only place on women?

The reality is, it’s so difficult being away from my daughter and she’s never not on my mind. Feeling this deep emotion, however, doesn’t take away from the fact that I am also a very ambitious and hardworking woman who loves building my own legacy that Dua can one day be proud of. 

We can experience both emotions without disregarding the other and we can cherish our roles as mothers and still pursue other passions. But ultimately this is a choice, and it is mine to make. 

I respect mothers that make the choices that most resonate with their values, and this does not have to be the same choice as mine. 
My wish is that we all respect mothers and the choices we make without jumping to label anyone as a “bad mother” when we never know the full story. 

I know Dua is having so much fun with her Dad, and this time they have together is also valuable for both of them. I can’t wait to see them both very soon! ❤️

These moments are not just random occurrences, but instead, they hold a special meaning and purpose.

When we open ourselves up to the possibilities of what these connections can bring, we allow for a deeper understanding of our own lives and the world around us.

Short of the Audi S8, of all the press cars I’ve had since arriving in LA (Mirai, Highlander, Sequoia, RX, Cayman GTS, Urus P) it was the car I most loathed to give back. The GTI fits my life like a glove.

‘Hot hatch’ is generous. Compared to FWD things like the Elantra N or Civic Type R, it's very much a warm hatch. It's got speed, sure, but it's very German everywhere else. Comfortable, refined, solid. Hair raising, it is not.

The key tag said Autobahn, but I accidentally had the base model. Which means this little 241hp manual pocket rocket squeezes in at a price of US$30,530.

Among other things, this robbed me of the upgraded Harman Kardon, the adaptive dampers, sunroof, bigger screen, fancy 19” wheels and leather seats. I can skip the last four (I love the plaid), but the only two I felt like I was missing were the sound system and the dampers. The ride was a little busy even on LA roads.

Seats are excellent, the driving position is ergonomic perfection and buttons aside (I’m coming to that), what a great steering wheel to grip. Lovely texture and diameter.

Practicality is astounding. I managed to fit our entire TH team’s production gear and everything my wife and I brought with us to LA in it. No small feat.

It’s delightfully zippy and well sized. Parallel park it in the city, easy. Rip through a canyon, easy. Slice through traffic, piece o’ cake. And all with four full-grown adults.

Aggressive shifting with the manual is not rewarded and is my only driving-related issue, especially the 1-2 shift but such is the price for FWD. The R fixes that and would probably be my pick.

What the R doesn’t fix is the interior. Mine had a volume knob (base model) but even still the steering wheel buttons are, at best, not at all satisfying. And two clicks to get to the heated seats after pressing the heated seat icon is dumb. But wireless carplay worked flawlessly.

I think the MK8 looks absolutely class. It takes the already handsome MK7 and streamlines it as if hit by a scirocco wind (see what I did there). I would own one in a heartbeat, interior gripes and all.

You feel tired and terrrible, so you take an immediate opposite action to the feeling: you do something that will build up energy. 

You do *not* double down on the behavior making you feel like trash. 

That’s IOA.

Another example:

You *feel* mad at, and distant from, your spouse. 

What do you do?

You can:

A. Double down on that feeling and distance yourself, shut down, get more mad, stew on negative feelings, get in fights. ie cause more of the *same*

Or 

B. IOA: immediate opposite action: flip the madness and challenge yourself to increase closeness, get present and kind. Ask questions. Hold space. Open up. Work through to a higher level. Generate what you really want: LOVE.

Funny how so many of life’s great improvements come from sensing negative feelings and then doing something to bring good things in versus double down on the pain. 

You can feel the feeling, acknowledge and understand it, but not be controlled by it and make a BETTER CHOICE. 

That’s free will and conscious behavior that changes your life. 

Share with someone today. Every day is a great day to learn and grow. 

Cheering you on today. 
Your coach,
Brendon.

Fresh, local ingredients to make the loveliest salad bowls that you can even build on your own from everything available on the menu.
Here's what we had and loved:
~ Build your own bowl: mine had butternut squash, avocado, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, cottage cheese and a bunch of other stuff.
~ Scrambled eggs on an open faced sandwich
~ Hot chocolate (highly recommend for those who consume dairy, it was YUM)
~ Pumpkin soup
Everything was fresh, light, yum and just as it should be 🤌🤌❤️❤️

1. It is adorned with a gorgeous red paint that makes me feel things. (That photo is unedited)

2. The infotainment is dumb.

I’ll get to that second point but I just lived with this car for 5 days and I’m mixed on it. 

It's very pretty. It also has a delightfully clean-looking interior and the ground clearance required to not be intimidated by LA’s silly dips in the road.

Like the other ‘subcompact crossovers,’ it handles like a hatch that’s just had a big lunch. It’s confident enough but compared to the GTI that I traded it with, it doesn’t feel nearly as tight, nor is the ride quality as good. I’m sure the torsion beam has something to do with that, as well as the heightened CoG.

There’s no denying that for $35K (US), a 250 hp AWD CUV with a 0-60 time of 5.8 seconds just needs to drive…fine, and it does. It’s powerful, though the 2.5 turbo trades fuel economy for speed (25mpg).

The steering is a strong point and it’s tuned lighter on the 30 than on the 50, which I'm very grateful for as it is far better suited to its class. AND in a rare un-Mazda like move, the seats are actually comfy. Driving position is good and its sleek exterior lines didn’t inhibit my visibility as much as I thought it might.

Rear seat space is compromised compared to the CX5/50s and annoyingly the back seats don’t fold flat. 

It’s missing wireless CarPlay and a good LKA. Also, Mazda’s obsession with removing touchscreens has reached its ultimate form. I include a video of me attempting to change the music with the dial only. Apple’s UI is partly to blame but all of that could have been fixed by letting me touch it. In fairness, my Audi was guilty of the same crime so keen marketers can now claim the CX-30 has an “Audi level interior”. Add to that, on multiple occasions since, the screen simply hasn’t responded to my inputs at all. The CX-30s way of telling me to ‘sit and spin.’

The subcompact crossover might be the least sexy class of vehicle of all time. But with soul red crystal clothing, good power and sleek looks, the CX-30 Turbo does what it can to make your trousers move. But it’s not perfect.

Thank you @punetimesonline, for highlighting the delicate and crucial postnatal journey of new mothers and how Yoga can be incorporated in their life to re-connect with themselves.

Breathwork, pranayama, inversions and certain asanas are what will help you to deal with pre and postpartum symptoms and bounce back to your old self.

Give this a read, we surely need more awareness when it comes to the post-natal journey of new mothers.

They may have been justified in feeling upset at one point, no doubt. 

Life is unfair and it hurts and truly awful things happen. 

But sometimes we don’t release that over time and bitterness creeps in. 

Soon, there is a “bite” to our communication and actions. 

Few realize this. 

But when they finally SEE IT and become self-aware…

If they can not shame themselves for it but just recognize it and choose to do the hard work of personal development… it’s a huge huge breakthrough. Because we all want to let go and find peace and joy and trust and vibrancy again. Just takes growth work. 

My podcast is called Motivation with Brendon Burchard but don’t think we don’t take on the tough stuff too. 

Cheering you on today. Your coach,
Brendon.

People ask me all the time about all the *external* results and successes of my career over last 20 years…

They think it’s business, marketing, sales, content, network, background, connections, etc. they see the numbers and fans and hear about the businesses and clients and bestsellers. 

But the through line is simple:

I love people. 

I have a real and cultivated spiritual understanding and care for people. 

I put love in my heart, even when I have reason to be angry.

I know you want love, understanding, belonging, care, appreciation, respect, support — deep down it’s always there. For me too. 

Give and you shall receive. 

Project love. 
Protect love. 
Give love. 

It’s your superpower. Sure is mine. 

Hey - love you today!
Your coach,
Brendon.

#GucciAttache, An Object of Desire. @gucci #gifted 
 
 A piece of contemporary design created from the awareness of a modern attitude and of the intentional revival of a historical object from the archive: Gucci Attache is a bag that reinterprets tradition and the system of House codes while transporting a silhouette, which draws from an intuition and an attitude of the 1970s, into the present through a narrative and gesturality outside the confines of gender, feminine or masculine.

Knowing how to use your whole brain isn't something you're taught or necessarily know how to do in school or anywhere. 💡⁠
⁠
If you haven’t listened to our podcast episode 231: The Secret to Using Your Whole Brain with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor (less than 20 mins), I highly recommend you do so. 💡⁠
⁠
If her name sounds familiar, it's likely because you watched her TEDtalk or read her memoir, My Stroke of Insight, which we've included on our recommended book list for many years now.⁠
⁠
In this episode we’ve discussed her newest book, Whole Brain Living: The Anatomy of Choice and the Four Characters That Drive Our Lives. This book is a myth-buster in so many ways. ⚡️⁠
⁠
Listen in as Dr. Jill discusses the myths of the brain and goes into the mechanics of getting your brain to work for you. If you've ever wondered what the secret for making good choices in your life is so that you can live the life you deserve and desire, this episode is for you. 💚⁠

When you have a car for a week, sometimes it starts great and then it does things that make you a little colder on it. This was the opposite, I warmed to the RX over time. But not completely.

The good: It hustles. The last two cars I had this month (Mirai, Highlander) were both 9 seconds to 60, so the sub 6 second time of the RX500h felt like lightspeed. And it has a hybrid FOUR cylinder! One that makes, wait for it…

366 hp and 406 lb ft. That’s about as good as it gets for a 4-cyl this side of an AMG. It feels genuinely quick and doesn’t sound bad doing it either. The powertrain, ahead of cabin isolation, is by far the highlight of this car. Matched nicely to the six-speed transmission, it is both smooth and effective.

We said the Highlander and the Crown feel lexus-like in the cabin and you know what, the Toyotas are definitely nipping at the heels of Lexus quality now. This isn’t a huge step up and in fact the roof had a constant creak that I wasn’t able to diagnose.

The seats are great and the Mark Levinson audio is superior to anything in a Toyota but some things are a step backward. I don’t mind the bigger screen but toggling between carplay and the native app is completely unintuitive. Also, modifying the cluster requires getting to second base with the steering wheel touch buttons while looking at the head up display to see what menu you’re changing [video in carousel]. A seemingly complex and unnecessary way to “get one over” on a Toyota.

It handles its 4,750 lb weight pretty well but it feels heavy in the corners. The Highlander felt more spry even with the third row.

Styling may sell you on this Copper Crest coloured RX. And really it IS rather nice, but at 90K CAD as specced, it's expensive. The Germans and the Genesis stuff are stiff competition at that price. Given the choice, I’d stick this powertrain in the Highlander and call it a day, even if that made the Highlander $10k more. But if that was possible, Lexus wouldn’t exist now would it?

Do you find yourself chasing material success and external validation at the cost of your emotional and spiritual well-being?

I have been having a lot of conversations lately with friends and clients who are struggling to find their true calling in life.

Many have chosen a path that they believed would lead to success and recognition, only to find themselves feeling empty and unfulfilled.

So, let me ask you a question:

What is your assignment?

What is it that you truly desire to do, regardless of the material rewards or the opinions of others?

What is the purpose that burns deep within your heart, waiting to be set free?

I know that it can be scary to pursue our true passions and purpose, to step out of the comfort zone of what we know and into the unknown.

But here's the thing - when we look to God, we already have everything we need. We are covered in His Armor of Courage and equipped with the strength to overcome any obstacle.

We are not meant to settle for a life that is anything less than extraordinary. We are called to be brave, to pursue our dreams with passion and purpose, and to never allow the opinions of others to hold us back.

So I urge you, my friend, to step into the fullness of who you are meant to be.

Trust in God's plan for your life, and let go of the fear that is holding you back.

Remember, when we are aligned with our true purpose, we are able to make a difference in the world, and that is where true fulfillment lies.

So take a leap of faith and follow your heart. Pursue your passion with everything you have, and trust that God will guide you on your journey.

You have everything you need to succeed - the courage, the strength, and the unwavering support of the divine.

So go out there and make your mark on the world. You were meant for greatness, and it's time to claim it.

It’s a story of Shreya and Rishabh and their budding romance since school days. The romance in this book felt like an Insta love and went to quick for me. The narration of the author gave me a feeling as if the protagonist Shreya was sharing her tale with me over a cup of coffee which makes the read quick and pacy. I enjoyed the read and what I liked about the book is that though it’s a piece of fiction a lot of parts and emotions felt relatable. It’s a heart warming story and a tear jerker book. I want to tell you more but I am not telling you about their story. All I am saying is that I loved it and my lips are silent 😊

Mind Your Mindset is by far the one that has sparked a new conversation I want to have with myself. About halfway through part 2, I realized that I have several stories I have been holding onto and will follow the process to re-write them and develop a new Narrator. Similar to Megan’s story about the fear of public speaking, mine is more about speaking up in meetings because no one will ever take me seriously, so I never bother. Just applying the first step, I realized that is not even supported with the data I have. Which prompted me to dig deeper into all the other stories I kept telling myself. Needless to say, if you ever wanted to break a cycle that you are in, reading this book will force you to confront those stories and make you ask if they are true.⁠
⁠
I cannot express how much I appreciate Michael and Megan for sharing their stories and research throughout this book.⁠
⁠
If you are looking to make a meaningful change in 2023, read this book and do the work. You may just find the breakthrough you need to make your dreams or goals possible. Thank you, Michael and Megan.” ⁠

⁠
Forget about your limitations.⁠
⁠
These are the preconceived notions you believe about yourself, such as that your memory isn’t good or that you’re a slow learner.⁠
⁠
We’re not born with pre-installed mindsets about what we’re capable of achieving—we learn these fixed and limited ways of thinking from the people in our lives and the culture we experience growing up. 💔⁠
⁠
Think of a young elephant tied to a stake in the ground. 🐘⁠
⁠
When it’s a baby, the elephant isn’t strong enough to pull the stake up, so it eventually stops trying because it learns the effort is futile.⁠
⁠
As the elephant grows, it gains more than enough power and strength to pull out the stake, but it remains tied up by something as inconsequential as a rope and a flimsy piece of metal because of what it learned as a baby.⁠
⁠
In Psychology, it’s called learned helplessness. 🧠⁠
⁠
Most of us behave like that elephant.⁠
⁠
At some point, we had an experience that gave us an impression of what we’re capable of, and our belief about our potential has been set ever since. 😞⁠
⁠
But just as helplessness is learned, it’s just as possible to learn to be limitless. ⚡️⁠

Now, I help others do the same by guiding them through the transformative power of kinesthetic exercises and transformative tools combined with Faith practices.

These practices allow my clients to tap into their own inner strength and find balance in the chaos of a disconnected world.

Remember this: anxiety is not simply an external force seeking to disrupt your peace, but an internal call to action.

It's a reminder from your inner child that it's time to tend to your needs and heal past wounds.

By heeding that call, you'll discover a newfound sense of productivity and peace that replaces anxiety so that you can return back to who God created you to be.

Through prayer and faith, I learned to trust in His love and provision, and found peace that transcends all understanding.

Whether you're a believer or not, know that you don't have to face anxiety alone.

God reminds us that we don’t need to control everything.

Stress is ‘Fear of Loss of Control’ and it is the reason why we stay on loop because we want certainty to feel safe.

But this is an illusion most of the time.

Call upon God in prayer to give you clarity and your steps will not be confusing but will be paced and more clear.

Take heart in the truth that God's love is available to all, and that He is always with you, ready to support and guide you through any struggle.

Have you ever experienced peace with God before?

I was not at all prepared for what I saw.

My mule whinnied and side stepped as we entered the light. I put my forearm across my face to shield my eyes, confused by what looked like church bells above me. I reined in Harry—I’d given him that name the day before—and we stopped. No bell tolls. All I heard was the traveler behind me.

'Get out of the way, kid!'

I was frozen. It took me a few seconds to realize what was swinging 10 feet over my head…”

The twelfth episode of my first scripted podcast is now live! The above is a snippet.

The “Legend of COCKPUNCH” podcast debuted at #1 in “Fiction” on Apple Podcasts and landed in the Top 100 for all podcasts on Apple Podcasts.

Everything can be found at cockpunch.com/podcast, or you can subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to podcasts. Search “cockpunch” and you’ll find it.

If you like fantasy or world-building, this will be my attempt to blend Tolkien with Alice in Wonderland. That’s the aspirational goal, at least. So, if you’d like a short break each week from doomscrolling, I invite you to join me on a strange adventure full of secrets, magic, and a tournament of champions…

The Weekdays offered a busy-ish schedule that made things easier (school, long naps) until it was time to break fast for iftar. On weekends, she could sleep until noon, but then what? That’s where the Food Network came into play.

Shows like Guy Fieri’s “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” Rachel Ray’s “30 Minute Meals,” and culinary queen Ina Garten’s “Barefoot Contessa” not only offered a productive timepass but the hosts shared advanced techniques and processes that 10-year-old Zaynab absorbed like a sponge: “When it came time to start preparing for iftar with my family, I could take the techniques I had learned and apply them.”

Eventually, the techniques and dishes Zaynab learned from watching the Food Network started inspiring her own experimentations with different cuisines. And now she sets the table with her own inspired additions alongside classics like rich Karak Chai and fluffy, crispy Mandazi (Mahamri).

You were created by God to be a weapon of mass creation and to support one another to be the best you were created to be while you are here on this earth.

As a coach, I guide my clients to navigate the dizzying and deceptive maze of the online world, which I refer to as “The Labyrinth”.

The more we immerse ourselves in consuming an overload of randomized self-help and marketing content, the deeper we sink into a vortex of comparison and self-doubt which keeps us in the maze of procrastination and business failure.

True coaches understand that the key to building a thriving coaching business lies in their unique abilities to deliver tangible, life-changing results for their clients.

And when you pair this principle above with the principle of knowing how to get clients and how to actually scale your business you will become unstoppable.

This can only be achieved by truly loving the art and craft of coaching and transformation and learning the ropes from someone who has walked this path for years.

I know this because I have worked with 12,000+ students online and offline over the last 14 years successfully and have taught thousands coaching tools and strategies so they can do it too.

Do you believe you are called to be a transformational coach so you can inspire and empower others to make a powerful change in their life?

My new season of Influential Coach - A four month LIVE online coaching high level Mastermind is now open for you to apply!

Over 142 coaches have graduated in this new program and have become certified to build their successful coaching business.

Are you ready to become a coach that gets clients and results too?

Would you like to make an extra 10k a month or more online coaching and using my transformational tools that I have been taking my clients through for the last 14 years?

If so then DM me the word “COACH” now and we can have a chat to see if you are the right fit.

Illusions can provide a sense of security, comfort, or control. They can be used to explain away complex issues, absolve us of responsibility, or to satisfy our desire for simple answers. But the truth is often messy, nuanced, and difficult to accept. It can be uncomfortable, painful, and even terrifying.

The truth has the power to change us, to force us to confront our shortcomings, and to challenge our beliefs. It can be a powerful tool for growth, but it can also be a source of fear and resistance. The willingness to accept the truth, even when it is difficult, is what separates those who are content to live in their illusions, and those who are truly seeking to understand the world around them.

It is a reminder that growth and progress can only happen when we are willing to let go of our illusions and embrace the truth, even if it is hard.

“If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” - Jesus

Add the Bronco Raptor to that list. We’ve said it since we first drove the regular Bronco: Ford got it right.

I was lucky enough to enter the desert once again with a Bronco Raptor, mere moments after the dust had settled from this year’s King Of The Hammers. I took my brother and brother-in-law and attempted to do what Bronco owners do, which is go out alone without a support vehicle and spend the whole time saying “See that hill? This could definitely handle that,” and then proceed not to do it because coward.

Saying that, we tinkled with some baja, we rock crawled and we sped up some sandy hills. All well within the comfort zone of the Bronco Raptor (and most probably a normal Bronco).

Unlike last time, when Thomas and I had about 5 hours in the desert with the Bronco Raptor, I had a full week living with it, which meant LA highways, parking in the city, grocery runs and canyon carving.

Out of the box, there is pretty much nothing the Bronco Raptor can’t do. I find Wranglers ridiculously charming, and their narrower dimensions and solid axle might win rock-crawling, but I’d sacrifice that for the Bronco’s better road manners. It’s size is definitely daunting, but its turning radius is impressive all things considered. And yes, it's loud on the highway.

The F-150 Raptor has a nicer ride, and sounds a little better with its tromboner exhaust, but the sheer road presence of the Braptor means that it’s absolutely loved by passersby. It’s for the G Wagon owner that has decided to stop kicking puppies.

Thematically, it feels like a petrol counterpart to a Rivian R1S. Take that how you will. But here’s the good news, I don’t think it needs the Raptor treatment. A normal Bronco can do everything I did on this trip. I know that because I’ve literally done the same stuff with a Badlands trim. The extra power is nice but the cost saving is significant, and you haven’t got to play your local dealer’s prick like a whistle to get one. 

Either way, please enjoy photos by my brother @danengelsphoto

⁠
A logical leap can be made when we subconsciously seek or give more weight to evidence that supports our own conclusions. Researchers call this confirmation bias. It’s always a temptation to favor any data that affirms our previously drawn conclusions and discount the rest.⁠
⁠
One of the ways you can interrogate a story is to ask someone else to examine it.⁠
⁠
By explaining to someone else why you believe what you do, you move from subjective to objective. You have to demonstrate how you drew your conclusion. As an added value, you’ll also gain a better understanding of your own story. Explaining your view to others will force you to think through it in ways you wouldn’t on your own. Your brain will make logical leaps and accept incongruities that others might not. What’s obvious to you probably won’t be to them and vice versa. ⁠

In reality, truth is exclusive and objective, not subjective or personal. We cannot claim to have our own version of the truth based solely on our feelings or opinions.

It's concerning that in the West, we are starting to prioritize our emotions over facts and critical thinking.

We've become so focused on the idea of individualism and personal experience that we forget the importance of objective truth and critical thinking.

This often leads to a dangerous path where we dismiss factual evidence or reject logical reasoning, all in the name of ""our truth"" or how we feel about something.

It's time we start to recognize that there is a difference between belief and truth. Beliefs are shaped by our experiences and perceptions, but truth is not.

Truth is based on evidence, facts, and objective reasoning. When we prioritize our feelings over facts, we are doing ourselves and society a disservice.

Let's strive to be more critical and objective in our thinking. Let's search for the facts and evidence before jumping to conclusions.

And let's stop using the phrase ""it's my truth"" as a defense mechanism for our beliefs. Instead, let's embrace the idea of seeking truth and using critical thinking to make informed decisions.

They were both man and woman, had four arms, four legs and a single head made of two faces.
Humans were very powerful creatures, fearless and strong, and even dared to threat the Gods. They threatened to conquer them and rule in their stead, and become the new Gods. So the Gods had to answer, and contemplated on how to face the humans’ threat. They thought of destroying humans completely, face them in a battle and kill them with lightning, as they did with the Titans. But if humans no longer were, there would also be no more tributes to Gods from the humans, a thought that the Gods did not enjoy at all.
So Zeus came up with another solution. They would split the humans in half and punish them for their pride and hubris. Apart from the pain that would cause them, they would also double the population of humans, hence doubling the tributes that had to be made to them by humans. And so they did and the humans everywhere split in two. These new creatures were living in complete misery, drenched in their pain and sorrow. They were so sad that they wouldn’t eat or drink for days, not caring if they died.
Apollo, God of music, truth and prophecy, healing, and light, could not bear see them like this, so to ease their pain, he sewed them up, reconstituted their body forms and just left the navel as the only reminder of their original form. So, humans went from double face and double sex creatures with eight limbs, to single faced ones of a single sex, with two arms and two legs. And they forever longed for their soul and physical other half. Their physical nature would feel a burning desire to be completed with the physical nature of the other sex, and their soul alike would yearn for their soul’s other half be complete, their soulmate. And according to the myth, when these two halves find each other, there will be a silent understanding of one another, they will feel joined and exist with each other in unison and will know no greater joy than that.

The fashion cycle is constant but there are still moments that ground us in artistry and tradition. The Gucci Jackie 1961 bag is one such moment.
 
A key design of The House for decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the #GucciJackie1961, beholds the Jackie story, but with a new perspective. An emblematic bag known for its half-moon shape, pared-down silhouette, and sleek piston hardware now carries itself with a non-binary attitude, transcending social constructs and time itself.

The Jackie 1961 boldly takes on any outfit, perfect for any occasion with its timeless elegance. To me, the Gucci Jackie 1961 bag represents an identity that is always growing but nevertheless stays connected to the core of its beauty.

When we do, we’re liable to make connections that aren’t really there. We make logical leaps in the way we connect the dots of our story.⁠
⁠
One such error occurs when we allow our goals to shape our stories. When we are focused on a particular outcome, we may miss key information that would change the story. Researchers call this cognitive bias.⁠

⁠
These seemingly “unachievable goals” are the reason Megan Hyatt Miller and I wrote Mind Your Mindset, which is why I’m moved when I read reviews like Cari’s.⁠
⁠
Here’s the story she shared with us after reading the book.⁠
⁠
“I’ve always wanted to lose weight. I’ve tried the Keto Diet, Paleo Diet, SlimFast (back in the day), and hiring a personal trainer. But something always seems to get in my way. I never seem to be able to keep it up. I get inspired at first, but somewhere along the way things get uncomfortable, I get tired or bored, and I give up. The “narrator” starts up and derails my progress.⁠
Mind Your Mindset helped me see the real problem is my beliefs about myself. The lie I’ve believed is a story that says, “I can’t do it.” Or “This is too hard.” Or “These other people’s issues are more important right now (kids, husband, employer).” Or “I don’t deserve to be thin.” The book showed me how to identify the false stories I believe, expose them for what they are, and write a new narrative that serves me better.⁠
⁠
Mind Your Mindset is about identifying your “narrator” (your mindset) and changing the narrative you are being told by your own mind and experiences. It helped me realize why I am not reaching my goals; that my narrator has been telling me a story that blocks my path to success.⁠
⁠
I would recommend it to anyone struggling with imposter syndrome, inability to accomplish a goal, or negative reactions to situations such as public speaking or dealing with conflict.”⁠
⁠
Like Cari, you can identify the lies that hold you back from your goals, and you can rewrite them to live a better, truer story. We show you how in Mind Your Mindset. ⁠

Especially in my marriage.

If I didn’t have persistence I wouldn’t be married to the woman of my dreams.

I’ve said it many times before, and so has she- she didn’t want anything to do with me when she first met me. She hated me.

Fast forward almost 2 decades and 2 kids later... we’re still standing strong.

Before I ever met Elena, I knew the type of wife I wanted but more importantly, I knew how committed I wanted to be to her. When I commit, I go all in. She was no exception. If anything, she was the rule.

I look back at the day when we got married, July 4, 2004, and I’m beyond grateful.

The reason for the legacy I’ll leave behind starts with my wife.

In life, you need a partner that will not only push you past your limits but will tell you the truth, no matter how harsh. You need a partner who aligns with your purpose and works at it with you every single day. We’re not perfect, but we know exactly what’s needed to make a marriage successful.

To celebrate our upcoming anniversary, we’re doing a Couples Retreat where you can join us with your partner and other 10X couples on April 15-16 in Los Cabos, Mexico.

The story is of two people obviously Avisha and Gautam it’s their love story in today’s world with the number of breakups and fear of commitments, reluctance of falling in love or giving love a second chance. All these emotions are a part of their journey and it’s their tale of connection with their baggages.

Let’s start cover to cover. Right from the the cover I knew it’s going to be a fun read and the book kept up to my expectations. This is one of those books that makes you smile and laugh along your busy schedule. The book is narrated in a chatty and a sectoral style which makes the read interesting and you sublimely are an integral part of the story. As the title suggest the book is about Shakuntala Bassi the bride to be and her father Ramswarup Bassi. Well Shakuntala has rejected thousand of boys but now she is rejected by Jacky Zinta by her dream man for a bizarre reason and we all know how difficult it is to take rejection. So anyways this father- daughter due team up to make Jacky agree to marriage. Also I guess all father and daughters will relate to it either the situations or the bond that Shakuntala and Ramswarup share. The question that lies here and the stories begins will they succeed? It’s a book I would recommend to read as it’s fast paced and entertaining. I throughly enjoyed it.

I’ve travelled a lot these past few months and learnt that sometimes we think we need something but in truth everything I need is right here in my arms. 
Nothing feels better than coming home to you @babykrispy. #babyandmi #babykrispy

A place where we live our dreams, and don’t have to plan,

I was definitely overwhelmed mesmerised by the magnanimous AdiYogi statue, the story the light show conveyed, meeting the students @ishahomeschool, meditating at the dhyanalinga, every little thing was just pure joy.

Last is an unedited selfie of me unhinged after waking up at 11am recently. I'm shifting things & energy in life/work (both are completely intertwined for me organically and i love it that way) and that has called for slowing down even more than what i was used to (I've always been a chiller for the most part). It's mostly a culmination of the last 2 years for me which feels like more of a life lived than the other 33 years in some ways and i hope to share it here when the time comes :)

This space can be held by a group of like minded women/ a circle of trust but in the case where some of us are not fortunate enough to have that , we need to be the ones to “listen “ and “see” our own selves ..to create a deeper space of healing , so we do not perpetuate our ancestral wounds to the next generation, but allow our own inner child to have a safe space to express what has not been expressed..

So after years of experiencing this and also coaching people through the process of identifying it and healing from it, this is gaslighting in a nutshell…

Gaslighting is when someone often tries to manipulate you and make you doubt your own perception of reality.

The gaslighter tries to control you and make you feel powerless, which can be really confusing and upsetting.

The person who is gaslighting you may have gone through some tough stuff in their own life. 

Maybe they were hurt, neglected or abused when they were younger, and that pain is still with them.

But instead of dealing with it, they take it out on others.

It's not your job to fix their problems, but it might help you understand that they are hurting too. 

That doesn't excuse their behavior, but it might help you feel less angry or ashamed.

You can still protect yourself, set boundaries and find support to heal from the gaslighting.

None of us are perfect and we all slip into a form of gaslighting at some point in our life but when it is not attended to or is a constant go-to tactic in relationship it can be extremely selfish and manipulative.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. You have the right to trust your own experiences and feelings.

Don't let the gaslighter dim your light or make you feel crazy. You are not alone, and you can heal from this.

Have you experienced gaslighting from someone close to you?

If so what did you do to communicate to the person and/or heal from the after effects of it?

Right from the very beginning from the title itself the book had me. What an intriguing title it’s a short novella with small chapters which makes it a day or two to read. It was my first book of the year and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this piece of fiction penned by Jayanthi as the narration style is fresh and I also like the style of storytelling specially the format. There are many other quotes and sub plots that I loved in the story  that I am itching to tell you all but I shouldn’t land up giving you all spoilers. I rather have you’ll discover it but never the less let me tell you a little about the story Susan is a kid from Goa and she has found a pen pal from Singapore Suiyi who is of the same age and they share their emotion through their letters. ( It took me back in time when I had a pen pal from Nagpur and I enjoying writing my heart out to her) back to the story they both have turbulent personal lives and though both are in different places and have different journeys in life they are still very connected. The author through her story and characters portage strong human behaviours, emotions; she has laid out beautiful different complexities and challenges that each one of us face within our circle with our closed ones or with the ones in our surroundings.
I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoy fiction and emotions that feel inspired from real life events and are looking for a quick thrill read to start their reading challenge.

⁠
Attention exists to help you not only survive, but to thrive—if it’s trained.⁠
⁠
Does your mind get easily distracted? 🤯⁠
⁠
If you haven’t listened to our 🎧 podcast episode 316: How To Focus Your Distracted Mind with Adam Gazzaley (less than 19 mins), I highly recommend you do so. ⚡️ ⁠
⁠
Dr. Gazzaley is the David Dolby Distinguished Professor of Neurology, Physiology, and Psychiatry at UCSF. He’s the founder of Neuroscape, host of a national PBS show, and the co-author of The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World.⁠
⁠
It’s impossible to put all of your focus everywhere at the same time. That’s simply not how the brain works. 🧠⁠
⁠
But being able to ignore certain stimuli isn’t a process that comes naturally. You have to learn how to direct where your attention goes.⁠
⁠
If you’ve been struggling with how to concentrate, focus, and minimize distractions in your daily life, this episode is for you.⁠

Things that depreciate out purchasing power & suffocate us financially.

We increase our value not by looking for the system to give us direction, but by educating ourselves son how wealth is built.

Let’s make 2023 the year where we insert wealth principles & values into our family.

Timeless and versatile, the Jackie continues to elevate looks era after era with such elegance. A key design of the House for many decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the Jackie 1961, emerges to transcend traditional accessories classifications with its pared-down silhouette, piston hardware, and non-binary attitude.
A longstanding signature within the House’s collection, the Jackie is perfect for every occasion, no matter the hour, no matter the destination.

I love reading love stories as they all are unique in their own way. It’s my favourite genre and the cover just like it’s title promises unique love story. The story is of Raj, Deepak, and  Kashish but not the usual triangle. The book has some fresh air and as you read and the story keeps unfolding it will amaze you. It’s a story not only about life but also about Afterlife. I liked the narration style of the author ( here would like to bring a little thing to your notice that avid readers don’t go on the language just read and flow with the story and the characters. Dwell deep into that) for the beginners it’s apt will make you fall in love with reading too as it’s a short book with a powerful story which you can read at one go or in a couple of sittings. I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional grip that the author has on you with his story and I PROMISE you will too

It’s all about the sauce, I always say to double it (: Ranch on the side with baked French fries. Perfect dinner.

⁠
The reviews have been phenomenal, but we’ve also received questions from people that are skeptical about the whole idea of “mindset”.⁠
⁠
One question we keep hearing is this: “How can my thoughts hold me back from success?”⁠ It’s a good question, and it’s one I wrestled with for a while as well, so if you’re confused by this, you’re in good company. ⁠
⁠
Here’s how it works.⁠
⁠
As high-achievers, we often have a bias toward action.⁠
This means that when we don’t get the results we want, we focus on changing our behavior⁠. We analyze our routines, our systems, and our processes, trying to find areas for improvement. ⁠
⁠
In other words, we go straight from the problem to finding a strategy.⁠
⁠
Through our research, we’ve identified a missing step: the story we tell ourselves about the problem. ⁠The way we see the problems we face changes the strategies we create.⁠
⁠
This is how “mindset” can impact your success.⁠
⁠
If you don’t take the time to analyze the stories you tell yourself about the problems you face, you risk getting stuck with insufficient strategies that keep you from your goals.⁠ But when you peel back the layers and identify the real problem, you’re left with new strategies that accelerate your progress.⁠
⁠
Want to learn how to analyze your thinking to fast-track your success?⁠ We show you how in our new book, Mind Your Mindset.⁠

each of whom are pioneers in their field because of their passion and dedication not only towards their profession but towards creating and establishing a healthier world.

@sonushivdasani is the founder and designer of @discoversoneva and the person behind the outstanding Soneva Soul which was a creation of his personal experience with fighting and overcoming cancer and then integrating all the treatments and so much more into it. 

Our Talkers Table (to be revealed soon, stay tuned) is all of us sharing our zeal and experience of our respective fields and bonding over our common purpose of improving health for each and everyone around us. 

@parineetasethi the power house of @globalspa_mag not only organized this incredible Talkers Table but also managed to get the amazing @rohanshrestha to shoot a cover with us.

These 4 days of work, masti and laughter formed a bond between all of us that was possible only at magical Soneva!!

I expect difficulty and do my best to rise up to meet it as a challenge of my character and commitment and service. 

Sometimes I suck at dealing with struggle but I’m rarely surprised that I have to deal with it .. and that’s been an unfair advantage I think. 

Expect it. Deal with it with a good attitude. Stay optimistic and in motion baby and you just get better and better at dealing with it and you find your flow even on the rough patches.

It can be hard to deal with the fear of being embarrassed, judged, or seen as less than. It's easy to get stuck in a cycle of our own doubts and fears.

But I've learned from my own experience that most people are so caught up in their own thoughts and worries that they're not even listening to yours.

The truth is that we all feel insecure sometimes, and that's okay. But if we let them run our lives, they can stop us from living the way we want.

Let's not let the fear of being embarrassed control what we do. Instead, let's embrace the power of self-acceptance. Let's give ourselves permission to be vulnerable and take risks, even if it means we might get embarrassed.

Because in the end, knowing we are already loved by God and that our own thoughts are the only ones that really matter is so powerful to know. And when we can accept ourselves, flaws and all and give the rest to God, we open ourselves up to a whole world of possibilities.

So, the next time you let your fear of being embarrassed keep you locked up, remember that you are not alone.

We all have fears, but it's up to us to get over them and live the life we want.

Share this message with your friends and family, let's start a conversation and break the cycle of self-doubt together.

Me No Pause Me play by Manoj Kumar Sharma 

I highly recommend this book to all. It’s a book that I would ask All you to read from Men to Women. It’s a game changer for the society if all us resonate with it which I am sure you will. You know it’s a book which highlights a very strong message which actually we all take very lightly in our lives. If you see the Title without without space you will realise what the story is all about ME NO PAUSE —— Menopause. Yes it’s about it that all we women go through but along with us even our families are a part Because the change is not just in the hormones there is a change physically as well as emotionally. It’s a short book with deep message for everyone out there. It’s like perfect to the T as it explains the entire journey of a women in all spheres of her life. He has touched all the challenges she faces from biological to emotional. The author has put across with utmost simplicity. Also the characters are just three and each of them are so extremely well crafted that you feel you know each of them. Also the way the story culminates and it ends keeps you in positive spirits. It’s a soulful read 
Happy Reading Bookstagrammers

This Series 8 watch by @apple holds the future of health and will revolutionise the way we workout and I loved learning and sharing with each and everyone. 

Thank you to the gorgeous, powerful ladies who came to breathe and flow with me!

I loved superheroes as a kid and I love them now. 

They are flawed figures that inspire us to be better. 

I still read comics today. 

With nonfiction we learn through information. 

With fiction we learn through imagination. 

Enjoying fiction has been shown to enhance empathy, creativity, EQ and more. 

Especially excited that today is the release of #BlackAdam - The most unstoppable force on the planet. 

As you’ll see in the video from the premiere, it took @therock 15 long years to make this movie. 

Like most things worthwhile it took belief, grit and dedication. 

Imagine that future you know is possible. Step into it. See it. Feel it. Believe it. Then work daily for it. 

He’s like the character he plays in the film:

Powerful energy 
Relentless force
Intense purpose 

When you sit down and watch the movie you will definitely feel it. ⚡️

I’m going to watch it again this weekend, anyone else? 👇

⁠
A reminder that when you only do what’s easy (put things off, procrastinate, the least effort, etc), life is hard. ⁠
⁠
Do what’s hard (and even a little scary), and life becomes easier. 💪⁠
⁠
Because like building any muscle - growth and strength is developed outside our comfort zone.⁠
⁠
Ask yourself, will the rewards outweigh the effort?⁠
⁠
If yes, quiet the noise and get to work, because intelligent consistent action (especially when you are scared or don’t feel like it) cures most everything, including the fear itself. ✨⁠
⁠
If that doesn’t motivate you, then at least use fear wisely and to your advantage.⁠
⁠
Instead of being scared of doing the thing you know you should do, be more scared of what you will lose by not doing it. ⁠

I have read books penned by the author in the past and I must say he is one of my few favourite authors when it comes to reading this genre. He can hook you right from the very first page of his book. It’s happened with me in the past and it’s the same feeling right now while I was reading “The Highway Murders”. The book is based on a true story of a psycho killer named M Jaishankar. The story is breathtaking and can be read in a sitting or two but I took my time as the details are gory and I needed my break time from part or part. The author as usual has very very well researched the topic and written the story in a way that it catches your eye and mind from the cover right UPTO the end. It’s a fascinating true story which I would recommend all to read who like this genre it’s got the facts but it still doesn’t sound academic. It’s gruesome but very intriguing. So happy thrill reading this weekend

Core +bent and straight arm strength of shoulders +legs all adds up to better efficiency of movement, the stronger your muscles (not necessarily bigger muscles though!) the lighter your movements.💪🏽🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🔥
.
These drills done 2 times a week alongside your practice can really help big time .
Do them for a month or 2 at least consistently to see any results.
Remember consistency is the name of the game , not jumping into every new program/ coach/ training/ trainer/ yoga teacher every few days.( the same with diets!!!!!🤪) 

NOBODY can give you the magic pill , the teacher/ coach can show you to the best of their ability , finally you HAVE to do the work.
It took me years of training any new movement/ asana/ handstand to be able to do it finally.
.
So here are the drills.
.
1️⃣Bent arm Lolasana Push/ ups : 5 reps* 3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
2️⃣Lolasana Lift-ups : 5 reps *3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
3️⃣Push ups (if you are advanced do them with straight legs ): 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
4️⃣L- Sits : 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
5️⃣Tolasana : 5 reps * 3 sets

I felt like sharing here our simple chanting together,
The first chant is Gayatri Mantra to the Divine Source , We meditate on that most adored Supreme Lord, the creator, whose divine light illumines all realms (physical, mental and spiritual).

The second mantra we chanted  was Triyambakam or Mahamrityunjaya Mantra to Lord Shiva for health, longevity and healing.

⁠
As someone who's dedicated his life to unlocking the full potential of the human mind through learning and self-development, I can tell you that the journey is not always easy.⁠
⁠
It requires a willingness to push beyond our comfort zones and embrace discomfort.⁠
⁠
But the reward is well worth it - by tapping into the vast abilities of our minds, we can achieve our goals and become the best version of ourselves.⁠
⁠
So don't let the fear of change or the pain of growth hold you back from unlocking your limitless potential.⁠
⁠
Remember, staying stuck in a situation that doesn't serve you can be even more painful than the discomfort of growth and change.⁠
⁠
Embrace the journey, and get ready to unleash the limitless power of your mind and open up a world of limitless possibilities for yourself! ⁠

The title and the cover lured me@into reading the love story and I have to say that the author has very brilliantly touched a very important topic and narrated it in a light manner. It highlights the subject of Consent. A topic which is very realistic and important part of every relationship well to give you a little snippet it’s a story of Anuj and Ruchi and what transpires later when Anuj kisses her without her consent. What fate has in store what transpires later when Ruchi disapproves and also decides to discontinue their relations and expresses her desire never to see him again. Arya Khanna, RU his aunt enters as a fairy god mother for Anuj and helps him Coe with it but she also helps him understand relationships as well as to mend things with Ruchi because he truly loves her and keeps pursuing her. It may seem like a simple love story but you in for a surprise that you never expected. The language and narrative style of the author makes the book fast paced and can be read by all I would strongly recommend this book to young adults and also to readers who love this genre 

Happy Reading :)

While we can't control someone else's healing journey, we can choose who we allow into our lives and take responsibility for our own heartbreak.

And of course, labeling every heartbreak as a narcissist's doing is easy, but it doesn't always tell the whole story.

I’m noticing that people are becoming more selfish lately because of social media and all the selfie culture in this significance driven culture (which is what Jesus warned us would happen in these times 2,000 years ago).

“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men and women will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.” - Jesus (2 Timothy 3-5)

It’s important to not be pulled into the selfish survival techniques that so many use in society today.

I also see that sometimes people are wrongly accused of being a narcissist too because the one who is accusing is quick to throw the label out there and can’t see the part they played in the relationship breakdown.

Ultimately, taking ownership of our own choices in relationships means acknowledging our role in attracting and keeping certain people in our lives.

Only then can we break the cycle of toxic patterns and create healthier, more fulfilling connections.

Do you agree?

Don't give up on Love!

I know firsthand how painful it can be to have your heart broken and to carry the wounds of childhood into adulthood.

But I also know that healing is possible and that setting high standards for love is worth it.

Remember, the love you seek is seeking you too.

Have faith that your soul mate is out there, willing to build a family and a life with you.

My wife @sariniabryant showed me that soulmates do exist, and I believe that God brought us together.

You are deserving of a love that is healthy, real, and fulfilling too but it must be negotiated through your actions not just because you hope it will happen.

And when the time comes, the love that is revealed in you and your complimentary other will be worth the wait.

Keep your eyes open, your heart full and your head held high.

When you set the standard for how you want to be treated, you'll attract someone who's on the same page and ready to give and receive love in a powerful way.

I am forever grateful for the gift of my wife, and for the love that we share.

Together, we are a force to be reckoned with, and I know that with God on our side, there is nothing that we cannot overcome.

In Genesis 2:18 The Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”

This verse emphasizes the importance of companionship and partnership between man and woman, and highlights the idea that humans are created for relationship with one another.

It is in our Original Human Design to Love and be Loved 🧬❤️

So, if you’re reading this and you have felt doubt about your relationship journey along the way - Keep moving forward with growth and trust that when the time is right, you'll attract the soulmate you've been praying for 🙏🏼

Sarinia and I believe in the power of Real Love for you too ❤️

Recently, that meant braving downtown Miami traffic for a 9 p.m. Thursday reservation at Gekko, the superstar's new clubstaurant-slash-steakhouse. The restaurant is a loud and bustling affair, complete with a vibey red glow, a 🥩 steak for $1,200 (nope, not a typo), and plenty of vape juice floating through the air 💨. As a super-fan, Antara needed to know: Could dining at Bad Bunny's restaurant make her feel connected to the musician? Would his cheeky playfulness and personality somehow shine through on the menu?

As human beings, we often have this misconception that we can do everything on our own. We feel like we have to be self-sufficient and independent, that relying on anyone else is a sign of weakness.

But the truth is, there are some things in life that we just can't do alone. We need help, guidance, and support.

And that's where God comes in.

When God takes us to a place we can't venture alone, it's not because we're incapable or weak, it's because there's something we need to learn or experience that we can't do on our own.

Maybe it's a lesson in humility, or a chance to develop our faith, or an opportunity to connect with others in a deeper way.

Whatever the reason, we can trust that when God takes us to these places, we're not alone. God is with us every step of the way, guiding us, protecting us, and providing for us.

It's a reminder that we don't have to be self-sufficient, that we can lean on God and on others when we need help.

And that's a lesson that we can all relate to, because no matter how strong or independent we may be, we all need our creator to make sense of our Purpose and direction in this world.

Or maybe you have and you wonder what would happen if you do leave the certainty of all you’ve ever known.

Well 14 years ago I lived a typical life, working a 9-5 job and felt trapped in the rat race of working for a boss. It was a comfortable life, but deep down, I knew I was meant for something more.

One day, I took a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for coaching. I poured my heart and soul into building my business, determined to create transformation in the lives of many.

It wasn't easy, but with hard work and dedication, I managed to build a thriving coaching business that reached 7 figures.

As fate would have it, I was given the opportunity to feature in a documentary film called Think & Grow Rich.

It was an incredible honor to be a part of such a renowned project, and even more so, to attend the red carpet event alongside inspiring individuals like Rob Drydek, Lewis Howes, Barbara Corcoran and Bob Proctor. 

Looking back, I realize that my dreams were always within reach. It wasn't about being lucky or having connections, but about leading with service and becoming an entrepreneur that genuinely cares about making a difference in the world.

My journey is a testament to the fact that anyone can achieve their dreams if they have the courage to pursue them. It's never too late to take that leap of faith and become the person you were always meant to be. May my story inspire you to follow your heart and create the life of your dreams.

If you’d love to learn how to build a legit 7 figure coaching business online so you can work from anywhere then DM me the word ‘FREEDOM’ and let’s have a chat. I have something to share with you.

She cooks dal, barbacoa, and chicken curry for her husband and two children; her family's grocery staples include Goldfish crackers, eggs, cheese, fruit snacks, and fish. Her three year old loves caviar... yes, caviar. ""My mom used to work 12-hour shifts in a factory, come home, and make bhaji, chapati, rice 🍚, and dal every day for us,"" she writes. Her family immigrated from India to the US when she was eight. ""I occasionally spend more 💲 on one meal than [my parents] probably made in a month.

The reading world is clearly clear about this book and the extent to which this novel will scare you Co relates directly to whether you believe in these events. However writer convinces you into this world with his simple narration style. The chapters are short and the twist and turns are in abundance. It’s a story of five friends Maya, Ravi, Riya, Shreya and Mayank who met for a reunion after ten long years. It a story of how their joyous moment turned out to be the worst nightmare. I can’t disclose more as I might land up giving spoilers so rather you’ll buy your spoiled and spook yourselves as once you begin to read the author traps you in his dark plot. I rate it high as a horror book it’s done it’s job amazingly well.

Highlights:

6.5L Naturally Aspirated V12 paired with three electric motors (2 front, 1 rear) that altogether make 1,001 Horsepower.

Redline is 9,500 RPM.

AWD.

New in-house developed transverse 8-speed dual clutch.

2.5 seconds to 60. 217 mph top speed.

Battery can recharge fully in 6 minutes from driving (regenerative braking and the V12)

New Citta (City) mode, which is EV only and has 6 miles of range.

Lighter and stiffer frame than the aventador but dry weight is still about 500 lbs more despite a carbon monocoque.

At first glance, it looks like they’ve thrown everything at this. And the plugin stuff would scare us if it didn’t work so extraordinarily well in the 296 Ferrari we just tested. Pluck my butt hair and call me Sally because we’re ready for this new almost 4,000 lbs Italian monster, are you?

Are you having a rough start-of-the-week?⁠
⁠
Take a pause and check yourself.⁠
⁠
Self-care is not selfish - it's necessary. ✨⁠
⁠
So take a moment to check in with yourself and see how you're really doing.⁠
⁠
Often, we get so caught up in our daily routines that we forget to prioritize our own well-being.⁠
⁠
But if we don't take care of ourselves first, how can we expect to perform at our best in other areas of our lives? 🧠⁠
⁠
So if you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just not quite yourself today, that's okay. Take a deep breath, center yourself, and remember that you have the power to reset your day and start fresh.⁠

Success follows when you make yourself a priority.⁠

Fighting battles bigger than themselves, 
But their strength and courage,
Shines brighter than any star in the sky. 

Today and always, we stand with our little fighters.
 
Every child deserves a chance to grow up and fulfil their dreams. 

Let's unite on International Childhood Cancer Day to raise awareness and support the little fighters. 

Together, we can make a difference and give hope to children fighting cancer.

Community advocate Lora Smith sees ancient mountains and lush forests that provide the backbone of the 13-state region; an amalgam of bustling cities and rural hollers, with a globally connected economy pulsing at its center since colonization. What makes the food so distinct can be found in the people who love and fight for this complex place. In this package, you'll find recipes, personal essays, and travel guides that represent the glorious and delicious range this region offers.

At the link in bio, there are recipes for @silveriocovozzi8's Pork Shoulder Inasal, @crystalwilki's Peppery Chicken and Dumplings, @dash37board37's Spring Greens With Hot Bacon Vinaigrette, and @lisamariedonovan's Appalachian Apple Stack Cake. Plus, road trip itineraries to Pittsburgh, West Virginia, and East Tennessee's must-eat pit stops and restaurants. A report by Rebecca Nagle (@rebeccanagle) about Cherokee chef @elisi_oklahoma, whose food reveals how Appalachian cooking traditions found their way to Oklahoma. And last but not least, heartfelt writing by @annette_saunooke_clapsaddle, @lisamariedonovan, and Rick Bragg about the personal histories behind Appalachian food like dried apples and biscuits. 📸 Photography: @cahlinetompkins

Here’s what I will be upto in a snapshot in 2023:

- Soak in the morning sun every morning 🌞
Let the warmth embrace you as you start your day with yourself by yourself

- My Pranayama is my everything 🌬️
Breath work centres you, brings you back to yourself and gets you ready for the day

- Meditate everyday 🧘🏻‍♀️
Start simple with even 5 minutes, work your way up and feel the magic ✨

- Hydrateeee!!!!! 💧
Your water intake truly makes such a big difference in the way you feel 

- Be kinder to myself 💌
The narrative your adopt to talk yourself matters, make sure its a positive one

- Keeping loving myself ❤️
Love truly makes the world go round and it starts with loving yourself first

So, What are you challenge yourself with in 2023? Let me know in your comments and share with everyone you know 🖤

Throughout my 29-year entrepreneurial journey, I've launched 9 businesses, only 4 of which have become sustainable successes.

I started at the age of 7, and every step of the way, I've learned that failure is an essential part of growth.🌱

The path to mastery can be messy, but it's the journey that truly shapes us – not the accolades we collect along the way. 🏆

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce my INFLUENTIAL COACH certification program! 

This 4-month online program distills my 14 years of coaching expertise, empowering you to become a transformative coach and build a thriving 6-7+ figure career. 🌟

If you're ready to start a coaching business from scratch or elevate your coaching practice then send me a DM with the word 'COACH,' and I'll share the application details. 

If you make it to the second round, we'll have a personal call to ensure we're the perfect fit. But act fast – we're already 55% full! ⏳

Not quite ready to become a full-time coach? That's okay! Share your most significant failure-turned-success story in the comments below.👇 

I can't wait to hear your journey.

Let's embrace the lessons together and create a legacy of true impact. 💫

I’m not much of a department store kind of shopper , always preferring the charming stand alone stores, off the beaten path. 
But Printemps has a certain je ne sais quoi which you need to see to believe. Aside from the stunning interiors and beautiful curation , they have an entire floor dedicated to vintage finds including hard to get Hermes bags and fine jewellery. They also have a space dedicated to last seasons hot pieces sold at reduced prices. If that’s not enough to sway you , they have a great personal shopper service and if you can’t make it to the store , they have an entire set up to help make your online shopping experience personalised and seem less. 
Wow, I just realised I literally went on a rant but I truly was very impressed.

1. Reflect with faith - Seek God's guidance to understand past relationship patterns and areas for growth.

2. Embrace divine compassion - Allow yourself to grieve the loss and remember that healing is a process. Trust in God's love and mercy to heal your heartbreak.

3. Prioritize self-care & spirituality - Nurture yourself and deepen your connection with God.

4. Set God-guided boundaries - Establish clear boundaries, create a Vision for the type of relationship you desire to create and ask God to have his co-creative presence in the vision with you.

5. Practice gratitude - Practice gratitude for the lessons learned and the growth you've achieved through the experience. Recognize God's hand in shaping you through life's lessons.

6. Seek help & spiritual guidance - Consult professionals and faith leaders to support your healing journey.

7. Trust God's timing - Give yourself time to heal and grow, understanding that the process takes time and is unique for each individual. Trust in God's timing and plan for your life.

8. Embrace vulnerability with faith - Open your heart to new connections, trusting God to lead you to a fulfilling partnership.

By incorporating faith in God, you'll heal, grow, and attract a partner who truly resonates with your soul.

Have you experienced God’s presence and guidance in your life during times of healing?

Interrogate them, then reimagine how you would state a more positive story.⁠
⁠
Start small. Begin using “get to” rather than “have to,” for instance. This might require some practice and a little persistence. ⁠

For example, replace “I have to go to work.” with, “I get to go to work.”⁠

Right from the title it has my heart and mind I was curious to solve the riddle and there was no stopping as I perused the book it was a complete page turner thriller. It was fun and fast paced. It’s a thriller but quite different from the ones that I have read lately. The story and the characters are very well crafted by the author it’s so descriptive that the visuals automatically play in your mind. 
To give you a little clue before you get on to solve the riddle yourself. The story is of Siddh an interior designer, an introvert personality and has an obsession with blue butterflies. One day he find a mysterious box and that contains a butterfly and a diary and does begins his quest to find the answers of what when where and how did this box reached the doorstep and so does ours. I would love to say a lot more in my excitement but I rather have you ll read it for yourself and enjoy the thrill.

.
I’ve been off my inspired self for a while, but the last few days I got a strong message from the Universe and  via some incredible friends to get back on track .
So I’ve gotten back with all the practices that really bring me joy to bring in the energy of creativity , abundance and all the juiciness I’ve missed ..
.
One of the things that always brings me joy besides yoga and meditation is making my own vibrant food . So here goes my recipe for today:
.
Alchemy Smoothie:
•Handful organic kale/ spinach 
•mixed berries 
•frozen medium banana 
•250 ml cashew milk 
•scoop of Vegan protein (I use @sunwarrior collagen peptides tathitian vanilla )
•1/2 teaspoon maca (amazing for hormones and is an incredible adaptogen ) 
Blend up in a high powered blender .
Top up with dried berries , bee pollen and any yummy things you like to add colour and vibrancy.
The secret ingredient though is adding the best intention and gratitude to your food.That is where the true alchemy lies.💫✨🔱❤️🍇🦋

The shiva pendant is from @sheetalzaveribyvithaldas 🙏🏻🔱❤️

BUT, I did not do it by myself, it was a collective energy shared within a small group of individuals guided and led by the one and only Anne Hockett.
My journey, my experience throughout the days were amazing! as it helped me not only feel light and cleanse my GUT but find grounding within even though I was still working and training clients!!!

⁠
1️⃣ Keep your goals visible. The first page of the Full Focus Planner is designed to facilitate daily goal review. Just scanning your list on a regular basis will help you make progress; you’ll be more attuned to next steps—the small but meaningful actions that get you one step closer to achieving your goal.⁠
⁠
2️⃣ Connect to your why. To amplify that effect, review your goal motivations on a weekly basis in your Weekly Preview. Stay connected to whatever compelled you to pursue the goal in the first place. The more you can find deeply personal motivation for achievement the better.⁠
⁠
3️⃣ Pivot as necessary. What matters is the destination, not how you get there. As our CEO Megan Hyatt Miller often says, “The goal is sacred, but not the strategy.” That’s why she and our founder, Michael Hyatt, wrote their new book Mind Your Mindset. It’s practically a manual on how to pivot when you need.⁠
⁠
Your goals matter. That’s why you set them in the first place. Don’t let them die like a plant you forgot to water. Keep them visible, stay connected to your why, and change your approach until you reach your destination.⁠

@tahirakashyap is a force to reckon with. She's bold, unfiltered, unapologetic and has created an identity of her own. Her nuanced writing and empowering women-centric stories make her the perfect fit for our Women’s Day special digital cover.
 
The filmmaker confesses how she didn’t indulge in self-love for the longest time and used to look down upon herself, “For me that was being narcissist, but there’s a huge difference between self-love and narcissism. Self-love is truly constructive, while narcissism is very destructive.”

Are you juggling too many hobbies and business ventures without focusing on your true purpose? 

Maybe it's time to take a step back and reassess your priorities. While exploring multiple interests can be exciting, it can also lead to a scattered and unfocused approach.

So, before you get lost in the chaos, ask yourself, ""What is my true purpose, and how can I use my skills to achieve it?""

Remember, it's never too late to refocus and pursue your passions with purpose.

A wish is a vague aspiration like “get healthy” or “make more money” or “fall in love.” A goal, on the other hand, is a specific, actionable intention. It’s something you can do. ⁠
⁠
A study out of Duke University found that people with more specific goals gained more momentum and grew in motivation as they progressed, while people with less specific goals had the opposite tendency. They lost steam along the way and reported a decline in motivation, even when they made some progress. ⁠
⁠
So the trick is to sharpen your expectations into specific goals that you can do something about.⁠

Over & over again :)
The 1st day of my birthday month got hijacked by mind numbing period pains but when i finally came to it and gathered my nervous system back together and sat with myself here's what came up.
Message for the month is one of patience. Even though i like to believe that i am mostly a very patient person sometimes i do give into being in a hurry towards things that need to take their time to unfold.
And my intention for this month is to keep inviting my shadow to show up and chill in bright light with me because that's just the work i happened to be indulging in right now. 
Like i said. The kind of dance i like to keep showing up for.
But also, the dance of mama nature herself ❤️

It’s a very exciting read as it’s a historical fiction with a lot of mythological references which were exciting factor me as I love both the genres and it’s rare that they are clubbed together. It’s a book which completely absorbs you into its pages. The story is fascinating and authors narration style, character crafting and minute detailing makes you engrossed in the read. It’s a book that needs your 100 percent attention as there are lots of tales woven together along with the main tale of Bappa Raval’s ascent to the throne. Special claps for the author for his research as the book contains a lot of historical information which will excite the history enthusiast. The narrative style of the author takes you in the past of these historical figures, his descriptive style makes you feel you are in that era. The entire scene comes to life. The cliffhanger that the author leaves you at makes you want to read the other parts soon. I am impatiently waiting for the sequels to follow. I recommend this book as it’s entertaining and enlightening as it’s based on historical heroes who have been forgotten or we aren’t aware of them besides that has a lot of spiritual layering to it

If you neglect them, the weeds of misunderstandings, miscommunications, and mistrust can quickly take hold, and before you know it, the beautiful relationship you once had can become overrun with negativity.

But just as a garden can be restored to its former glory with a little bit of TLC, relationships can be salvaged as well. The key is to recognize the warning signs of neglect and address them before they have a chance to grow.

Nurturing a relationship means actively showing your appreciation and affection for the other person.

And finally, attention is crucial for any relationship to thrive. This means being present in the moment and actively listening when the other person speaks. It means putting aside distractions like phones or work, and really focusing on the person in front of you.

Giving your full attention to your loved ones lets them know that they are valued and respected, and that their thoughts and feelings are important to you.

-

Are you passionate about helping people build better relationships? Do you want to create transformation in the lives of those who are struggling, no matter where they are in the world?

If you answered yes, then you're exactly the kind of person I'm looking for!

As an online relationship coach, you have the unique opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of others. And the best part is, you can do it all from the comfort of your own home.

If you're ready to take your passion to the next level, then join me for 4 months of training to build your confidence as a coach and grow your coaching business.

You'll learn everything you need to know to be a successful online relationship coach.

So if you're ready to make a real impact in the world and help others build better relationships, then DM me the word 'ONLINE COACH' and let's get started!

Don't wait - the world needs more compassionate and skilled relationship coaches like you.

I have massive respect for him for not backing down and sharing the truth of the agenda that shadowed over us the last 3 years when most buried their heads in the sand.

Isn’t it crazy how so many so called “conspiracy theories” have come true lately!?

True bravery isn't found in the absence of fear, but rather in the face of it.

It's standing firm in your beliefs, even when it means standing alone, and weathering the storm of criticism and backlash.

To all those who refuse to be silenced, who speak unapologetically in the face of adversity and stand ground when arrows fly - your courage is an inspiration to us all.

Which conspiracy theories did you end up losing followers for speaking up about which is now a fact? 👇🏼

The timing was uncanny. It was almost like she waited just to see her great grandson and hold him. She waited to see that I was doing okay in my new role as a mother. And then she left us in the most serene & peaceful way and there is no other way I could imagine for someone as spiritual & positive as her.

""Dave Hollis, former President of Worldwide Distribution at Disney, passed away peacefully at his home outside Austin, TX on Saturday night. Though exact cause of death has yet to be determined, his family confirms he had been hospitalized recently for some heart issues. He was 47.” 

Dave was a good man, a loving father, an inspiring teacher, and a dear friend. 

We spent a lot of time together. I loved his caring and empathy, his energy and enthusiasm, his vulnerability in sharing his struggles, and his love of his children and helping people. 

We taught for a year together and the depth of his sharing and wisdom had me and our audience in tears so many times.

I loved our funny conversations, how he taught, how many great laughs and grand plans we shared. 

We were just together last month with friends when he was hospitalized with heart-related issues. He was released okay and I got to share with him then our love for him then, as did our friends. He knew he was loved. 
It sounds like those heart health issues continued. 

We are sending our love, prayers and condolences to his family and all our shared friends and communities saddened by this news today. 

It feels unreal- Tomorrow would have been Dave's birthday. 

Please pray for his family and give them space and prayer. 

I will miss you my brother. 
Rest In Peace dear friend.
